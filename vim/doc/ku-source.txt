INTRODUCTION					*ku-source-introduction*

*ku-source* is a source for |ku| to deal with sources.  You can choose and
switch to a source from all available sources.  This source provides another

current source is switched to this source.  The cleared one will be restored
whenever the current source is switched to another source.

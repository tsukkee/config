ACTION TABLE					*ku-buffer-action-table*

default						*ku-buffer-action-default*
			Same as "open".

open						*ku-buffer-action-open*
			Open the buffer specified by the selected item in the
			current window.  If the selected item is not completed
			one, it is treated as the name of a file or
			a directory, and it will be open by |:edit|.

open!						*ku-buffer-action-open!*
			Like "open", but use :buffer! or :edit! to open the
			selected item.

unload						*ku-buffer-action-unload*
delete						*ku-buffer-action-delete*
wipeout						*ku-buffer-action-wipeout*
			Do |:bunload|, |:bdelete| or |:bwipeout| on the
			selected item.  If the selected item is not completed
			one, nothing will be happened.

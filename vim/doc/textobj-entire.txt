==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*textobj-entire-introduction*

*textobj-entire* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select the entire
content of a buffer.

- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.7 or later (vimscript#2100)

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*textobj-entire-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*textobj-entire-mappings*

These key mappings are defined in Visual mode and Operator-pending mode.

<Plug>(textobj-entire-a)			*<Plug>(textobj-entire-a)*
			Select the entire content of the current buffer.

<Plug>(textobj-entire-i)			*<Plug>(textobj-entire-i)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-entire-a)|, but leading and
			trailing empty lines are excluded.




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-entire-customizing*

				    *g:textobj_entire_no_default_key_mappings*
					    *:TextobjEntireDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_entire_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is loaded
(e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use |:TextobjEntireDefaultKeyMappings|
to redefine these key mappings.  This command doesn't override existing {lhs}s
unless [!] is given.

	{lhs}	{rhs}			~
	-----	----------------------	~
	ae	<Plug>(textobj-entire-a)
	ie	<Plug>(textobj-entire-i)

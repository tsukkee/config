==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*textobj-indent-introduction*

*textobj-indent* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select a block of
lines with the same indentation level.

For example, if the content of a buffer as follows:
(here "|" means the cursor and "_" means an indentation)
>
	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	  _|if another_condition_is_satisfied
	  ____call s:do_x()
	  __endif

	  __...
	  __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif
<
|<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| will select lines as follows:
(here ">" indicates the selected line)
>
	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	> _|if another_condition_is_satisfied
	> ____call s:do_x()
	> __endif
	>
	> __...
	> __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif
<
|<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)| will select lines as follows:
(here ">" indicates the selected line)
>
	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	> _|if another_condition_is_satisfied
	> ____call s:do_x()
	> __endif

	  __...
	  __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*textobj-indent-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*textobj-indent-mappings*

These key mappings are defined in Visual mode and Operator-pending mode.

<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)			*<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)*
			Select a block of lines with the same indentation
			level.  More precisely, select lines which are:
			- adjacent to the current line, and
			- indented the same or more amount
			  as the current line, or empty line.

			If the current line is empty, the indentation of the
			next line will be used to select.  If that line is
			also ampty, the indentation of the next line of that
			line will be used instead.  And so forth.

<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)			*<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)|, but it doesn't
			include empty lines.




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-indent-customizing*

				    *g:textobj_indent_no_default_key_mappings*
					    *:TextobjIndentDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_indent_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is loaded
(e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use |:TextobjIndentDefaultKeyMappings|
to redefine these key mappings.  This command doesn't override existing {lhs}s
unless [!] is given.

	{lhs}	{rhs}			~
	-----	----------------------	~
	ai	<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)
	ii	<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)




==============================================================================
BUGS						*textobj-indent-bugs*

- |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| and |<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)| count indentation
  level by the number of leading whitespace and/or tab.

- The current selection is not extended like |aw| nor |ip|
  whenever |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| or |<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)| is
  repeated in Visual mode.

- So that [count] is just ignored.

- See |textobj-user-bugs| for further information.

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION				       *operator-replace-introduction*

*operator-replace* is a Vim plugin to provide an operator to replace
a specified text with register content.  This is shortcut for several types of
operations such as "d{motion}P" and "c{motion}<C-r>{register}".


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |operator-user| 0.0.5 or later (vimscript#2692)

Latest version:

INTERFACE					*operator-replace-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS				       *operator-replace-key-mappings*

["x]<Plug>(operator-replace){motion}		*<Plug>(operator-replace)*
			Replace text that {motion} moves over with register x.




==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*operator-replace-examples*

(A) At first, you have to map arbitrary key sequences to
    |<Plug>(operator-replace)| like the following:
>
	map _  <Plug>(operator-replace)
<

(B) Suppose that you edit a buffer with the following content:
    (note that "^" indicates the cursor position)
>
	(herb oil pepper) salt water
	^
<
    If you yank "sugar" into register x, now you can replace any text with the
    yanked text.  For example:

	To replace the 2nd word:
>
		w"x_iw
<
	To replace inside the parens:
>
		"x_ib
<
	To replace the cursor line:
>
		"x__
<




==============================================================================
BUGS						*operator-replace-bugs*

- Combinations of wises of {motion} and register content are not considered
  well, especially with blockwise ones.

- See also |operator-user-bugs|.
